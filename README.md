## Project Overview
This project utilizes painting descriptions from the San Rafael Auction Gallery to build a predictive model for painting prices using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary NLP technique employed is the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorizer, which transforms the text descriptions into a numerical format that can be fed into a machine learning model.
